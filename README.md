## What is Express?

Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity, speed, and ability to build APIs quickly. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, simplifying the process of writing secure and fast server-side applications.

Alternatives to Express.js include Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework, and Fastify, a high-performance web framework.

## Installing Express.js

To start a new project, you should first initialize the Node Package Manager (NPM) by using the `npm init -y` command in your terminal. This command creates a new 'package.json' file in your project directory, which will keep track of all your project's dependencies.

After initializing npm, it's also highly recommended to install 'nodemon'. Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server, which can greatly improve your productivity when developing Node.js applications

```
npm install -g nodemon //global add nodemon
npm install --save-dev nodemon //as a development dependency

npm install express
```

## It is all about Middleware

Middleware in Express is a series of functions that get called by the Express.js routing layer before your final request handler.

It's like a pipeline: the request goes through the middleware functions in the order they are defined, and each function has the opportunity to modify the request and response objects. This is useful for tasks like parsing incoming data, adding headers, handling authentication, logging, etc.
